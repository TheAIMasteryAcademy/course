## What you will be able to do

- Explain features, labels and a model, using a real dataset.
- Explain why we test a model on data it has never seen.
- Tell supervised from unsupervised learning, and regression from classification.

**Before you start:** [lesson 0.2](../02-what-is-data).

## Key ideas

- **Rules vs learning.** Instead of writing the rules ourselves, we show the computer examples with the right answers, and it finds the rule.
- **Features and label.** The features are what we know (bill length, flipper length). The label is the answer we want to predict (the species).
- **Training.** An algorithm looks at the examples and builds a **model**: a rule it learned from the data.
- **Testing.** We keep some examples hidden during training and score the model on them afterwards. It is like an exam with new questions, not the ones you practised on.
- **Overfitting.** A model that memorises the training examples, noise included, scores well in training and worse on new data. We want a model that learns the pattern, not one that memorises.
- **Types of learning:**
  - **Supervised** learning has labels. Predicting a number is **regression**. Predicting a category is **classification**.
  - **Unsupervised** learning has no labels. Grouping similar things together is **clustering**.

## On real data

Can we tell a penguin's species from two measurements? We used 342 penguins (the two with no measurements are left out). We trained a small model on 256 of them and kept 86 hidden for the test.

- The first rule the model learned: **flipper longer than 206.5 mm means Gentoo**. That one rule alone is right for about 98% of the penguins on the Gentoo-or-not question.
- With one more rule on bill length, it separates Adelie from Chinstrap too.
- This small model got **84 of the 86 hidden penguins right (98%)**.
- A model allowed to grow as big as it likes got 100% on the training penguins but only 95% on the hidden ones. That is overfitting, on a real dataset.
